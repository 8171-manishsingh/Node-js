# Todo Layout Improvement Plan

- [ ] Replace emojis with modern SVG icons (view, edit/save, delete).
- [ ] Update color scheme to a modern palette with gradients and softer tones.
- [ ] Redesign todo items as cards with shadows, rounded corners, and better spacing.
- [ ] Improve typography and hierarchy (larger fonts, better contrast).
- [ ] Add subtle animations and transitions for interactions (hover, add, toggle).
- [ ] Enhance responsiveness for mobile and tablet views.
- [ ] Ensure all existing functionality (add, edit, delete, toggle, modal) works seamlessly.
